**With AsyncAll you can perform asynchronous operations even the function is synchronous - fully combinable with Tasks and .NET 4.5 async/await-pattern.**

## Give Thanks

If you like the library and saved you time, then maybe respect this with a small donation to the [animal shelter of Stuttgart](http://www.tierheim-stuttgart.de/).

If you want to thank me personally, take a look at [my personal Amazon wishlist](http://www.amazon.de/gp/registry/wishlist/H6KLKT7UMI7Z/).

It would be also very nice when you just write me, if you like this implementation and tell me what you've started!
